#Overview
To evolve the lip-sync avatar streaming service from MVP to production, plan in phases that progressively harden functionality, scalability, reliability, and operational maturity.
##Phase 0: Foundations & Planning
Define success metrics (latency target, frame rate, availability).
Select core technologies (WebRTC/RTMP ingest, phoneme model, Unity build pipeline, cloud provider).
Establish project repositories, branching policy, CI/CD skeleton, infrastructure-as-code template.
Secure avatar assets pipeline and licensing.
##Phase 1: Proof of Concept
Implement mobile prototype that captures video/audio and streams to a local ingestion service.
- Build basic ingest that terminates WebRTC/RTMP and forwards raw media to a single Unity instance.
- Integrate Unity headless renderer applying prerecorded viseme sequence to verify overlay pipeline.
- Output composited stream to a desktop client to validate end-to-end latency (non-optimized).
- Instrument simple logging for frame timestamps and drop counts.
##Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product
- Replace prerecorded visemes with live phoneme extraction (e.g., wav2vec, DeepSpeech); ensure synchronization using timestamps.
- Implement session manager for basic auth, session tracking, and stream multiplexing to dedicated Unity workers.
- Deploy MVP stack on managed Kubernetes (or equivalent) with GPU nodes for Unity pods.
- Add lightweight output streaming service (WebRTC or low-latency HLS) and allow same-client loopback.
- Introduce error handling: retry policies, health probes, session teardown on failure.
- Expose MVP metrics (latency histogram, Unity GPU usage, stream drop rate) to monitoring stack.
##Phase 3: Feature Hardening
- Optimize audio/video pipeline: adaptive buffering, jitter handling, time-drift correction.
- Introduce avatar configuration service (select avatar, blendshape profiles) and secure asset storage.
- Implement multi-region object store or CDN for avatars and textures to reduce latency.
- Improve Unity renderer: dynamic lighting, camera alignment, GPU instancing, graceful degradation on resource pressure.
- Add user-facing controls (mute, avatar selection) and analytics hooks.
##Phase 4: Scalability & Resilience
- Split services into independent autoscalable deployments: ingestion, phoneme processor, Unity pool, streamer.
- Introduce message bus (Kafka/NATS) to decouple ingestion from processors; support backpressure handling.
- Implement autoscaling policies driven by queue depth, GPU load, and per-session metrics.
- Add redundancy: multiple ingest gateways with global load balancer; warm standby Unity nodes.
- Build chaos testing and failover drills (simulate renderer crash, network partition).
##Phase 5: Operational Excellence
- Expand observability: distributed tracing across session lifecycle; detailed per-frame logs.
- Implement alerting with SLO-based thresholds (latency, availability, error rate).
- Harden security: mutual TLS between services, secrets rotation, vulnerability scanning, compliance logging.
- Formalize incident response runbooks, on-call rotations, and post-incident review process.
- Conduct penetration tests and privacy reviews; ensure data retention policies (GDPR/CCPA compliance).
##Phase 6: Production Launch
- Run load tests matching projected peak usage; tune autoscaling and resource quotas.
- Perform canary releases with automated rollback.
- Enable multi-tenant support and billing/quotas if applicable.
- Document end-to-end architecture, runbooks, and developer onboarding.
- Launch with SLA-backed service, monitoring dashboards, and customer support processes.
## Continuous Improvement
- Iterate on avatar realism, lip-sync accuracy (new ML models, fine-tuning).
- Expand device compatibility (network adaptation, codecs).
- Use analytics to prioritize enhancements (latency reductions, new avatar features).
- Maintain CI/CD enhancements (automated Unity builds, integration tests, synthetic monitoring).
